Stellar Distance and Luminosity Calculator 
This is a cross-platform GUI application built with C++ and wxWidgets, designed to calculate the luminosity of stars based on user input of stellar distance and other factors. The application offers a clean, interactive user interface that facilitates easy input and output.

Features:
Cross-platform compatibility: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
User-friendly GUI: Built using wxWidgets for a responsive and easy-to-use interface.
Input validation: Ensures that user inputs (distance, luminosity, etc.) are valid numeric values.
Dynamic panel toggling: Switch between different UI panels with features such as a back button for smooth navigation.
Customizable options: Start with an options panel where users can define parameters before proceeding with calculations.
Real-time calculations: Converts user inputs into results and displays star luminosity on the screen.
Outputs Display in scientific notation when necessary.

Notes:
Accuracy of equations verified and tested by using "Explorations: An Introduction to Astronomy" Tenth Edition by Thomas T. Arny and Stephen E. Schneider
